# swimmingpool
This is  a pool full of seals. They are floating around in the pool and are hungry, wanting to eat the delicious salmon on the shore.
Players can create ripples in the pool by making sounds through the microphone, and the seals will move up and down randomly. Try to help them eat more salmon!

The basic code was generated by AI and then modified for the poster image and the appearance of the swimming pool.
 Due to the computer environment not supporting and network issues, pygame and others could not be used, so the built-in tkinter was used instead.
